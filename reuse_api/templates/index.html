  <p class="lead intro">
    Welcome to the REUSE API. This service helps you to continuously
    check and display compliance with the REUSE guidelines. REUSE makes
    licensing easy for humans and machines alike. Register your project
    with us, make it REUSE compliant, and get your compliant badge
    today!
  </p>
  
  <p class="lead intro">
    If you are not sure what REUSE is, please head to <a

  <h2>Check your project</h2>

  <p>
    We offer a <a href="https://reuse.software/dev/">wide set of
    tools</a> to support you in adopting REUSE for your project. As a
    supplement, this API checks the REUSE compliance status for you.
    You can include a badge indicating the live status in your README
    file, and parse the output using the generated JSON file.
  </p>

  <p>
    All it takes is a registration of your project with this service.
    <a href="/register">Sign up</a>, confirm your email, and see the
    output.

      <h2>What is REUSE?</h2>

      <p>
        Copyright and licensing is difficult, especially when reusing
        software from different projects that are released under
        various different licenses. REUSE was started by the <a
        href="https://fsfe.org">Free Software Foundation Europe
        (FSFE)</a> to provide a set of recommendations to make
        licensing your Free Software projects easier. Not only do these
        recommendations make it easier for you to declare the licenses
        under which your works are released, but they also make it
        easier for a computer to understand how your project is
        licensed.

    questions. If yours is not answered here, please <a

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Which version control systems are supported?</strong><br />
        Currently, this service as well as the underlying <a
        href="https://reuse.software/dev">helper tool</a> only support
        Git. Please refer to <a
        href="https://reuse.software/faq/#no-git">our FAQ section</a>
        for more information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Which code hosting platforms are supported?</strong><br />
        As long as it is Git, we strive to support all platforms. We
        value decentralisation, so you will also be able to connect
        your own instance to our service. If yours does not work,
        please open an issue in our <a
        href="https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/api">project repo</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Can I register multiple projects?</strong><br />
        Yes, but please do not abuse our service and only register the
        projects you actually care for. We are a charitable non-profit
        organisation and habe limited server capacities. Also, please
        make sure to register and confirm your projects one-by-one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Are private repositories supported?</strong><br />
        No, but users who want to check the status of their private
        repos can <a href="https://reuse.software/dev/#ci">include the
        REUSE linter in their CI/CD processes</a>. If you would like to
        help us extend this service, you are welcome to check out the
        <a href="https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/api">code on our Git
        platform</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Which branches are checked?</strong><br />
        We only check the main branch when cloning your repository.
        This service does not support checking other branches
        currently. However, you can <a
        href="https://reuse.software/dev/#ci">include the REUSE helper
        tool in your CI/CD processes</a> to achieve that during your
        development.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Why do you need my email for registration?</strong><br />
        The REUSE API is a new service under continuous development. We
        would like to contact you if we need to introduce some breaking
        changes (which we will try to avoid of course). You will also
        be able to receive additional information about REUSE if you
        like.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>I want to change/delete my project here.</strong><br />
        If you want your project to be deleted here or have it changed
        (e.g. with a different address), please <a
        href="https://fsfe.org/contact">contact us</a>. But please be
        aware that anyone else can add your project again with their
        email address as long as it is a valid and accessible Git
        repository.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Can I see and reuse your code?</strong><br />
        Of course. The API's source code is <a
        href="https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/api">available under Free
        Software licenses</a>. Obviously, it is <a
        href="https://api.reuse.software/info/git.fsfe.org/reuse/api">REUSE
        compliant</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>

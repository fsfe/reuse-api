# REUSE API

These are the first elements for an API people can use to check their repo's REUSE compliance.

The idea is that users provide their repo's Git address and optional parameters (e.g. future submodule options), and we do all the cloning, linting, and provision of icons.

Having an API would also be important for inclusion in other services like shields.io or source forges.

## Installation

Currently, the Docker container is the heart. It is based on fsfe/reuse and contains the simple script `check-git.sh` in this repository.

To build the image, run `docker build -t reuse-api .`

## Usage

Running the check is fairly simple:

```text
$ docker run --rm reuse-api https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/tool
https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/tool is a valid git repository
